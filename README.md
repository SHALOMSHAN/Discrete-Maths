# Discrete Maths

## Introduction

Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete structures, such as sets, graphs, and integers. It involves the study of mathematical structures that are discrete and separate, rather than continuous. Discrete Mathematics is used in computer science, cryptography, and many other fields where exact calculations and logical reasoning are important. It includes topics such as logic, set theory, combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory, among others. Discrete Mathematics is a fundamental part of the mathematical foundation of computer science and is essential for understanding algorithms, data structures, and programming languages.
